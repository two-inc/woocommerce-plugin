## Compatibility with WooCommerce

The plugin has been tested for compatibility with WooCommerce version 9.9.5 with
[HPOS](https://woocommerce.com/document/high-performance-order-storage/) enabled. However, support
for the new [block-based checkout](https://woocommerce.com/checkout-blocks/) which is the default
since WooCommerce 8 is on the roadmap. You will need to use the classic checkout to use this
plugin in the meantime which has wide ranging compatibility. To revert to classic checkout:

– Edit the Checkout page (in Admin > Pages)
– Remove the Checkout block
– Add a Shortcode block, and enter `[woocommerce_checkout]` in the text field
